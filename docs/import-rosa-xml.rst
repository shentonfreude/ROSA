=========================
 Import ROSA Data as XML
=========================

ROSA developers added an XML export so that BIANCA could retrieve and process data.

Go to the URL:

https://merope.hq.nasa.gov/rosa/ws/hdmsrosa/all/main/RosaExportXml

I click Token login, then give my username and pin+token code.

It will deliver you to a differnet page; enter the same URL again.

The file should download in about 3 minutes and at this writing is 21.5 MB.
