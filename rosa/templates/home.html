  The Repository of Supported Applications is a web application for
    browsing and querying information about NASA HQ applications,
    including application description, support team, security
    compliance, architecture and interface(s) for current
    applications, applications in development and archived
    applications. Key reports such as the Applications Pipeline and
    Release Planner are available to all authorized users as well as a
    sampling of graphic reports currently provided in the Application
    Monthly Review (AMR).</p>

<h2>How to Use It</h2>

<p>You can use the search box in the upper left of each page to search for applications by acronym, name, and description (more attributes later).</p>

<p>Use the menu-bar <a href="{% url acronyms %}" class="label label-info">Acronyms</a> to
browse all the applicaitons by acronym, then drill down to a specific
one to see an overview of each release.</p>

<p>The <a href="{% url app_versions %}" class="label label-info">All Versions</a> menu-bar item
displays an overview of all applications and all their versions,
color-coded by the status of the release.</p>

<p>The menu-bar <a href="{% url search %}" class="label label-info">Search</a> button will
eventually offer a sophisticated interface for complex queries, but
for now duplicates the quick search box in the upper left of ever
page.</p>
