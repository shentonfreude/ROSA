  The Repository of Supported Applications is a web application for
    browsing and querying information about NASA HQ applications,
    including application description, support team, security
    compliance, architecture and interface(s) for current
    applications, applications in development and archived
    applications. Key reports such as the Applications Pipeline and
    Release Planner are available to all authorized users as well as a
    sampling of graphic reports currently provided in the Application
    Monthly Review (AMR).

<h2>What's New in ROSA</h2>

<p>Version 2.0 is written from scratch in Django. It uses Twitter
  Bootstrap for a "responsive" user interface that gracefully resizes
  for different platforms (desktop, mobile). It uses a serverless
  database SQLite or the PostgreSQL database.</p>

<h2>How to Use It</h2>

<p>You can <a href="{% url app_versions %}">Browse all applications
    and their versions</a> or you can <a href="{% url search %}">Search by
    text</a> in common application attributes.  The links here are the
  same as those on the top menu bar.</p>

<h2>Search</h2>
<p>Get started quickly by entering your search text here.</p>
<div>
  <form id="search" method="POST" action="{% url search %}" class="well form-horizontal">{% csrf_token %}
    {{ form|bootstrap }}
      </br>
      <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary"><i class="icon-search icon-white"></i> Search</button>
  </form>
</div>
